    <p>
        <B>Introduction: </B>&nbsp;
        The first generation marked the beginning of electronic computing. These computers relied on vacuum tubes, which were bulky and prone to failures. They were primarily used for military and scientific calculations. <br>
        <b>Key Features:</b>&nbsp;
        Operated on machine language (binary code).
        Large, expensive, and consumed massive electricity.
        Input was via punched cards, and output was printed. <br>
        <b>Examples:</b>&nbsp; ENIAC, UNIVAC, IBM 701.
    </p>
    <b style="color: red;">(2)&nbsp;2nd Generation Computers (1956–1963)</b><br><br>

    <p>
        <b>Introduction:</b>&nbsp;The second generation replaced vacuum tubes with transistors, which were smaller, more reliable, and energy-efficient. This was the era when computers became faster and more commercially viable. <br>
<b>Key Features:</b> &nbsp;
Used assembly language for programming.
Data storage improved with magnetic tape and disks.
Introduced peripherals like printers and disk storage. <br>
<b>Examples:</b>&nbsp; IBM 1401, UNIVAC II.
    </p>
<b style="color: red;"> (3) &nbsp; 3rd Generation Computers (1964–1971)</b><br><br>
<img src="./images/3rd gen.jpg"><br>
<p>
    <b>Introduction:</b>&nbsp; This generation introduced integrated circuits (ICs), which combined multiple transistors into a single chip. This breakthrough made computers smaller, faster, and cheaper. <br>
    <b>Key Features:</b> &nbsp;
    Operated on high-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL.
    Use of keyboards and monitors for interaction.
    Multiprogramming capabilities allowed running multiple tasks simultaneously. <br>
    <b>Examples:</b> &nbsp;IBM System/360, PDP-8.
</p>
<b style="color: red;">(4) &nbsp; 4th Generation Computers (1971–Present)</b> <br>
<img src="./images/4th gen.jpg" alt="">
<p>
     <b>Introduction: </b>&nbsp;The fourth generation is characterized by the advent of microprocessors, where the entire CPU was integrated into a single chip. This led to the development of personal computers (PCs). <br>
    <b>Key Features:</b> &nbsp;
    Use of graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
    Widespread use of networking and the internet.
    Emergence of portable devices like laptops and tablets. <br>
    <b>Examples:</b>&nbsp; IBM PC, Apple Macintosh.
</p>
<b style="color: red;">(5) &nbsp; 5th Generation Computers (Present and Beyond)</b><br>
<img src="./images/5.5th gen.jpg" alt="">
<p>
    <b>Introduction:</b>&nbsp; The fifth generation focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. These computers aim to mimic human thought processes and offer unparalleled processing power. <br>
<b>Key Features:</b>&nbsp;
Use of natural language processing and voice recognition.
Development of parallel processing and supercomputers.
Applications in robotics, expert systems, and cloud computing. <br>
<b>Examples:</b> &nbsp; IBM Watson, Google DeepMind, quantum computers.
